## The Analytical Breakdown

The ranking gap is substantial: **ATP No. 12 vs outside Top 100 territory**. But rankings alone do not create edges. Efficiency metrics do.

### Hard Court Performance (Last 12 Months)

- **Ruud win rate:** **64%**
- **Wu win rate:** **48%**
- **Ruud hold percentage:** **83%**
- **Wu hold percentage:** **78%**
- **Ruud break rate vs Top 50:** **22%**
- **Wu break rate vs Top 50:** **14%**

Ruud's breakpoint control is decisive. He saves approximately **63–65%** of break points faced. Wu sits closer to **57–58%**.

> **The Alpha Stat:** Against Top 30 opponents in the past year, Ruud wins above **60%**. Wu is below **20%**.

That gap compounds over two sets.

## Probability Mispricing Creates The Edge

At **1.44 odds**, implied probability equals:

**1 / 1.44 = 69.4%**

If true probability is **77%**, expected value becomes:

EV = (0.77 × 1.44) − 1  
= **+10.9% projected ROI**

In efficient ATP markets, sustained edges above **5%** are rare. This qualifies.

Straight-sets projection sits near **61–63%**, while market pricing implies roughly **55%**. There is secondary value in the 2-0 outcome.

## Risk Factors

Three variables could introduce volatility:

1. Ruud first-serve percentage dropping below **60%**
2. Wu redlining aggressive returns early
3. Slow adjustment to altitude conditions

If Ruud’s serve efficiency dips, variance expands quickly.

## The Bottom Line

The market is directionally correct. It is not fully efficient.

A projected **77%** true probability versus **69% implied** creates a measurable edge.

Back Ruud. Keep stake sizing disciplined.
