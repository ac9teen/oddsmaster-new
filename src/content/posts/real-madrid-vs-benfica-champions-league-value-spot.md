## Madrid’s Home Edge Is Undervalued

The market is pricing **Real Madrid** around **1.60** at home against **Benfica**, implying roughly **62.5% win probability**.

That number feels conservative.

Madrid’s profile this season reads: **24 matches, 19 wins, 3 draws, 2 losses**, accumulating **60 points** across competitions. At the Bernabéu, their control metrics spike further. This is not just pedigree. It is current dominance.

## The Analytical Breakdown

Madrid’s underlying performance numbers justify stronger pricing.

### Season Snapshot

- **Win rate:** **79%**
- **Goals per game:** **2.3**
- **Expected goals created per match:** **2.1+**
- **Expected goals conceded:** **0.9**
- **Home win rate:** above **80%**

Benfica, while competitive domestically, show regression against elite pressing sides. Against top-five European opposition over the past 18 months:

- **Win rate:** below **30%**
- **Conceding average:** **1.6+ goals**
- **Away clean sheet rate:** under **35%**

> **The Alpha Stat:** Madrid have won **19 of 24** this season, translating to a raw win rate near **79%**, yet the market implies just **62.5%**.

That delta matters.

## Quantifying The Edge

At **1.60 odds**, implied probability equals:

**1 / 1.60 = 62.5%**

Our blended [model](/#models), weighting home dominance, shot differential, and squad depth, projects Madrid closer to **69–71%**.

Using **70%** for calculation:

[EV](/#about) = (0.70 × 1.60) − 1  
= **+12% projected ROI**

Even adjusting downward to **68%**, expected return remains positive.

Additionally, Madrid’s scoring profile makes the **Over 2.5 goals** market interesting, given their **2.3 goals per game** and Benfica’s defensive leakage in high-tempo fixtures.

## Risk Factors

Champions League knockout dynamics can compress variance. Benfica are tactically disciplined and dangerous in transition. An early Madrid concession forces game-state volatility. If finishing efficiency drops below expected levels, this becomes tighter than projections suggest.

Back Madrid while the edge remains.
