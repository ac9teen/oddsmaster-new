1. In the admin panel, click **"Media"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Upload"** and select all images for this blog post (JPG format preferred)
3. Name your files using this simple format — **date + number**:
   - `250225-1.jpg` *(25 Feb 2025, image 1)*
   - `250225-2.jpg` *(25 Feb 2025, image 2)*
   - `250225-3.jpg` *(25 Feb 2025, image 3)*
   - If publishing multiple articles on the same day, add a letter: `250225a-1.jpg`, `250225b-1.jpg`
4. Once uploaded, each image will be accessible at: `/images/uploads/250225-1.jpg`
5. **Write down your filenames** — you'll need them when pasting the Markdown

> ⚠️ Image rules: JPG only. Max 2MB per image. No spaces in filenames.

### FEATURED IMAGE
This is the main banner image shown on the blog listing page and at the top of the article.
- Click the featured image field → select the **first image** you uploaded (Image 1)

---

### EXCERPT
This is the 1–2 sentence preview shown on the blog listing page and in Google search results.

**Rules:**
- Maximum 160 characters
- Must contain the single most interesting/surprising data point from the article
- Should make someone want to click

**Example:** `Our model gives Alcaraz a 68% win probability — but the market has him at just 52%. Here's why this line is wrong.`

---

### AUTHOR
Leave as default: **`OddsMaster Quant Team`**
(Only change if the article is attributed to a specific analyst)

---

### TAGS
Add **exactly 4 tags**, one per row in the tags field:

| Tag slot | What to put |
|---|---|
| Tag 1 | The sport or league (e.g. `ATP`, `Premier League`, `NBA`) |
| Tag 2 | The team or player name (e.g. `Alcaraz`, `Real Madrid`) |
| Tag 3 | The bet type or strategy (e.g. `asian-handicap`, `value-betting`) |
| Tag 4 | A general keyword (e.g. `match-preview`, `prediction`, `betting-strategy`) |

---

### BODY (Markdown)
This is the main article. Paste the full Markdown text that was generated by ChatGPT.

See **Step 4** below for the Markdown rules.

---

## STEP 4 — Markdown Rules (Body Field)

The body is written in Markdown. Here are all the rules you need to know:

---

### Headings
```markdown
## This is a Section Heading       ← Use this (H2)
### This is a Sub-heading          ← Use for sub-points
```
Never use `# Heading` (H1) — the title field handles H1 automatically.

---

### Bold Text
```markdown
Our model shows **67%** win probability vs. market implied **52%**.
```
Wrap any key stat, odds figure, or important term in `**double asterisks**`.

---

### Blockquotes (for power stats/key insights)
```markdown
> **Key Stat:** Teams trailing at half-time in the last 10 H2H meetings have covered the handicap **8 times out of 10**.
```
Use once per major section for the most impactful stat.

---

### Images
For **every image** in the article, paste this exact line at the point where it should appear:

```markdown
![Brief description of the image](/images/uploads/YOUR-FILENAME.jpg)
*One sentence explaining what this shows and why it matters.*
```

**Example with 3 images:**
```markdown
## The Data Case

Our model has tracked this fixture for 5 seasons...

![Odds movement chart for Real Madrid vs Barcelona](/images/uploads/football-realmadrid-barcelona-odds-1.jpg)
*Odds have shifted 12 points toward Real Madrid in the last 48 hours — a classic sharp money signal.*

The head-to-head record at this venue tells a clear story...

[[FACT_CTA]]

## The Edge

![Form table showing last 5 games for both teams](/images/uploads/football-realmadrid-barcelona-form-2.jpg)
*Real Madrid have won 4 of their last 5 at the Bernabéu; Barcelona are 1W-4L away from home this season.*

## The Bottom Line

![NanoBanana illustration of analyst reviewing data](/images/uploads/football-realmadrid-barcelona-illustration-3.jpg)
*The market is mispricing this fixture — our model sees 12% edge.*
```

---

### The FACT_CTA Block (Random Fact Card)
Place this tag **once per article**, ideally after Section 5 (Risks) and before the Bottom Line:

```markdown
[[FACT_CTA]]
```

This will automatically display a beautiful animated fact card on the live site. No extra work needed — it's already built in the website.

---

### Image Placement by Article Length

| Images in article | Where to place them |
|---|---|
| 2 images | After intro paragraph + Before conclusion |
| 3 images | After intro + Mid-article (data section) + Before conclusion |
| 4 images | After intro + After data section + After edge section + Before conclusion |

Always spread images evenly. Never stack two images back-to-back with no text between them.

---

### The Bet Recommendation Block
For prediction articles, always format the bet like this:

```markdown
**📊 Recommended Play:**
- **Market:** Asian Handicap
- **Selection:** Real Madrid -0.5 AH
- **Odds:** 1.92 at Pinnacle
- **Stake:** 2 units — medium confidence
- **Model Probability:** 61% vs. **Implied:** 52% → **Edge: +9%**
```

---

## STEP 5 — Publish

1. Click **"Publish"** (green button, top right)
2. The article will be committed to GitHub automatically
3. Vercel will pick it up and rebuild the site — **allow 2–3 minutes** before checking the live site
4. Visit `https://oddsmaster.vip/blogs/your-article-slug` to verify it looks correct
